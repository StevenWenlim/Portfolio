# Steven Wenlim Portfolio
Hello there! Welcome to my data scientist portfolio. This portfolio represents my journey as a data scientist, showcasing my skills and projects I have worked on so far. As a continuous learner, I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills. Therefore, I will keep updating this portfolio as I learn and grow as a data scientist. My ultimate goal is to become an expert in this field, and I believe this portfolio will reflect my progress and development as a data scientist. Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio, and please feel free to reach out to me with any questions or feedback you may have.
